    <p> Most cameras today are digital. Analog cameras has lost popularity over the last couple of decades, and it is fair on an introductory photo tutorial site to focus exclusively on the digital camera.
        There are three main types of cameras that we will cover here:</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="box1">
        <h1 id="pointand shoot">POINT AND SHOOT</h1>
        <p>These are the simplest to use (as the name implies) and offer the least amount of options when it comes to settings and manual control. A point-and-shoot camera also comes with a lense built into it. This lense can not be replaced.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="box2">
        <h1 id="DSLR">DSLR</h1>
        <p>DSLRs are cameras in which the light moves through the lens and hits a mirror, that will redirect it to the viewfinder. This lets the photographer see exactly what the digital sensor will see, thus making it easier to frame the picture correctly. The mirror is in front of the sensor, so when the picture is taken, it must mechanically move in order to let light pass onto the lens. This explains one of the characteristics of DSLRs, namely the fact, that youâ€™ll see a short, black flickering in the viewfinder just as the picture is taken.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box3">
        <h1 id="mirrorless">MIRRORLESS</h1>
        <p>These are the newest type and have quickly become very popular. As there is no mirror in the camera, the viewfinder and the camera monitor are entirely electronic. As a result of this the cameras are typically smaller and lighter than the DSLRs, and as the distance from the mount ring to the sensor is shorter, they can be set up to work with many different lenses (with the use of adapters).</p>
