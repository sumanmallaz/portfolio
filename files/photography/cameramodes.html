            <h3>Camera modes</h3>

            <p>A camera will typically have five different modes of operation. These modes are automatic, program, aperture priority, shutter priority and manual. You can shift between the operation modes using the large shift wheel on the top of the camera.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>AUTOMATIC</h3>
            <img src="img/cmm.jpg">
            <br>
            <P>The automatic modes is the simplest mode to use. All you have to do is click the trigger. The camera software will be in charge of all the settings for the image. This includes the shutter speed, the aperture, the ISO setting and the white balance. This is not just a great way to get started with taking photos, it is also a very useful setting, if your purpose is that of documenting where there is not a lot of time to mess with getting the settings right. The disadvantage is that you lose control the camera priorities.
            </P>
            <br>
            <h3>APERTURE OR SHUTTER PRIORITY</h3>
            <img src="img/aper.jpg">
            <br>
            <P>In the two priority modes you gain control over either the aperture or the shutter speed and the camera will automatically choose the other. This means that in one mode you can decide the shutter speed to fit if your motive is still or fast moving or perhaps if you wish to add motion blur to your image while in the other mode you can adjust the aperture thus controlling the depth of field (bokeh) and let the camera decide on the shutter speed.
                These modes are great for fast photography, where you still want to retain control over one essential setting.</P>
            <br>
            <h3>MANUAL MODE</h3>
            <br>
            <img src="img/cm.jpg">
            <P>Contrary to the automatic mode, the manual mode offers you complete control over all camera settings. This of course is much more of a challenge and will require you to understand, what the settings do in order to choose the right ones for the task.
                It used to require a high level of experience or a considerable amount of calculating to figure out all the settings for the right exposure. This is currently becoming much less demanding as a new technology has gained popularity: The mirrorless camera.</P>
