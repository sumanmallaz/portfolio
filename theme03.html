                <p>In this theme i gained knowledge of user experience design.It taught me to develop and design the product in the right direction and in productive way.. I got to know the various ways of data collection like desk research, observation research, interview, survey research. we were also introduced to content production through which we could help the people with there individual goal to find out what they want. I was also able to learn about user experience principles. This was a group project and we made a design sprint. This theme changed my way of designing a website as i learned to think like a user.

            In this theme, there was an assignment to be done in groups i.e. Design sprint. My role was fall-back decider and morale booster. This was our first group assignment where we were able to learn to work in groups. we were suppose to make a xd prototype for KEA cantene. We did some brainstorming to find problems and solutions for the existing canteen. Then we did some mapping to connect our process and sketching and also used crazy 8 ideas to choose the design for our prototype. And then we prepared a pitch for presentation.
